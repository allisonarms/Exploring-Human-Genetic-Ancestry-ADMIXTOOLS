# Exploring Human Genetic Ancestry with ADMIXTOOLS

## Project Overview
This project explores human genetic ancestry using SNP genotype data and ADMIXTOOLS in R. 
We focus on population-level comparisons across Neanderthals, French, Yoruba, and Cambodian populations.

## Dataset
- SNP genotype data (PLINK format: .bed/.bim/.fam)
- Data derived from the HGDP-CEPH panel
- Large raw genotype files are not included due to size limits

## Methods
- Processed SNP data in R
- Counted SNPs by chromosome
- Used ADMIXTOOLS for population genetic analysis
- Generated visualizations (bar graphs) to compare populations

## Key Analyses
- SNP distribution by chromosome
- Population comparisons
- Visualization of ancestry-related patterns

## Tools & Skills
- R
- ADMIXTOOLS
- PLINK data formats
- Data visualization
- GitHub version control
